# emitron Support

If you need help or assistance with using __emitron__ (the raywenderlich.com app), please don't file an issue on the GitHub repo.

Instead, check out [help.raywenderlich.com](https://help.raywenderlich.com/) for assistance, and in particular, [https://help.raywenderlich.com/faq](https://help.raywenderlich.com/faq) which has some details on the operation of __emitron__.

Thanks!
